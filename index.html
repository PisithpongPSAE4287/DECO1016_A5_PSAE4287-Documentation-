      <h2> Original Concept Ideas </h2>
      <p>
        During the stage of coming up with designs and website prototyping ideas, many methods were done to make sure that the final prototype would come out looking the best it could. This was done by going through processes such as: research, finding target audience, generating moodboards, sending questionnaires, doing interviews, and making sketches. Because my chosen charity is for helping sloths, I designed my website with the heavy use of Earth-tone colors.
      <p>

      <h2> Reflection on Proposal </h2>
      <p>
        With my limited knowledge of knowing how to code the website from scractch, I struggled a lot with figuring out with what of the elements were meant to do. Due to this inconvenience, it costed me roughly five days to watch the recorded lectures and online tutorials to provide me with more coding knowledge. With no prior knowledge to coding, I had to adapt myself and my original design to what was possible without the use of javascript. Since my <a href="https://deco1016a2psae4287.pisithpong.repl.co/#mockups">original</a> design had a lot of elements that requires javascript, iterations and changes were made to make it more suitable for the html and css codes. These designs that couldn't be done were the image carousels that were clickable as well as some of the sliding bars that can change the values. Therefore, this leads to some of the iterations that were needed to be made.

      <h2>Iterations</h2>
      <p> 
        Overall, there were quite a lot of changes throughout the design of the website. This was hugely due to my technical knowledge of actually producing the final outcome. Due to this, my capabilities were limited. However, some strong points such as the side navigation bar or the easy to navigate layouts for the users were kept. I've made sure that the users will be able to navigate around the tabs and pages easily with all the navigation icons and boxes available at all time during the visit of the website. There were also quite a number of new features that I decided to add to my website to provide more convenience to the users. However, the one main issue that I faced when designing the final website was the smaller-screen layouts since I didn't know that it had to be adapted for the phone screen. Due to this, for a clearer view for the users, some unncessary elements had to be removed to make it more navigatable.

      <h3> Final Website Designs </h3>

      <figure>

        <figcaption> About Page </figcaption>
        <p>
          When the user first visits the website, it will lead the user directly to this screen. As you can see, I've decided to change the layout quite a bit. Instead of putting the text at the right of the screen, I decided to put it under the title of the webpage on the left. This was mentioned during the testings of the prototype as writing the text at the right makes the website look boring. Due to this, I decided to replace the text with a photo instead. Since I received a comment from the tutors that the floating bars at the buttom seemed to be unnecessary and that the side nav bar would already be enough, I decided to delete the floating bar all together. Further, since this is a charity website, I've decided that there should be an easier way to persuade the user to donate the charity by adding the clickable buttons to the about page; this is to make sure that the user would see the buttons as soon as they visit the page.

        <figcaption>Navigation Bar</figcaption>
        <p>
          Instead of the original idea for the navigation bar. From the testings of the side navigation bar with the user, I found that it can be quite difficult for the user to navigate like that because the whole bar is spread across the height of the screen. Due to this, I decided to make it easier to navigate by reducing the margins between the buttons so that the user doesn't have to move the mouse around to much for navigating through the sections. I also made sure that the user knows that the sections are clickable by using the css property of cursor pointer. To provide the convenience of clicking the sections, I made the sections so that when the user hovers the cursor over, the box will lay a darker on it-signifying that it's being chosen. I've also decided to add a logo on top of the nav bar so that the user would always know what website they're viewing.

        <figcaption>Sloths Page</figcaption>
        <p>
          When the user clicks on the navigation bar to the sloths section, the website will direct to this part of the page. Since this is a long website, the user can also scroll down to view this section. As you can see I've still kept the minimalistic design from my initial concept design. Therefore, I decided to make the user see the cover page showing the section. In addition, instead of writing the text above the photo, I decided that it would give the website a cleaner look if the text is written in the middle. However, here, I faced the problem of the image being too bright; therefore, making the text unreadable. Due to this issue, I had to use css to make the image darker.

        <p>
          For this page, I decided to change the alignment of the texts. I changed the layout so that it wouldn't look similar to the about page. Due to this, I decided to make it look different by putting the text in column form instead. I decided to put the text section on top of the image for the left column while making the text section at the buttom of the image for the right side of the column. Overall, I think that this actually gives the page a cleaner look to the website page. The one thing that I decided to delete was the bottom part of the page as I found that I made the website look messier than it should be with the amount of texts; therefore, defeating the intention of keeping the minimal look of the website.

        <figcaption>News Page</figcaption>
        <p>
          This is one of the page with the most amount of iterations. The elements that I decided to keep were the search bar, the news topics, and the images showing the information. For the search bar, instead of making the user scrolling down and searching the topics by scrolling left and right by the use of the arrow buttons, I decided to add more features to it by putting the tabs at the top for easier topic browsing. For the news section that was meant to be at the bottom of the page, I decided to change this part around a bit by making it into a flip-card element to give the website more interactivies. Here, the user can preview the news by hovering the cursor over the boxes and box will flip over the x axis at 180 degrees revealing the articles. This was also done to keep the minimal look instead of my original idea of just putting the texts together like the interface of the pinterest application. What I found during the testing of the prototype was that, the pinterest tile layout worked great for browsing photos but not for texts/articles because it made the website look very unorganized. As I went deeper into researching what other websites include in the news section of the page, I found that videos were usually also added into the page. Therefore, I also added the video embeded into the layout as well.

        <p>
          Originally, the concept for this page looks almost nothing like this final website page. The reason behind this is that I found that the page had very little functions to what the whole page would be doing. In other words, the whole purpose of this page is there for the user to choose the amount of donation value that they want to give to the charity. I also decided to remove the slider bar that changes accordingly to the value of the donation amount as I found that it would only work with the java-script. However, since this assessment is only about html and css, I realized that the concept would not work. According to the original concept, I found that I forgot to add quite a few important elements for the user to donate such as the names, the email, the notes section, as well as the submit button. Due to such reasons, I decided to combine the designs of the contact page with the donation page.

        <figcaption>Donate Amount</figcaption>
        <p>
          Instead of creating the whole page for the donation part of the website, I decided to combine some of the design elements into one. For this section, I decided to turn the donation page into a page with places for the user to fill in their information and messages that they wanted to write to the organization. Here, instead of devoting part of the page for just clicking the donation amount buttons, I redesigned for easier usability and a more user-friendly design. I made it so that it would be more simple to use for how users would expect it to work. In the form section, I made it into a drop-down option that allows the user to choose the specific donation amount.

        <figcaption>Uploading Donation Receipt</figcaption>
        <p>
          This is an added feature to the donation page for making sure that the user actually donated to the charity. This section can be found under the donation drop-down section as I think that it would be the most reasonable place to put the function. By making the user upload the donation receipt it can help the charity make sure that the donation amount matches to the amount that they've received.

        <p>
          With the trends of the popular websites of limiting buttons and pages. I decided to change the layout of this page entirely. Instead of having a traditional contact page and to make the website have a cleaner layout, I decided that it would be a better idea to develop it into a floating verticle bar instead. Instead of making it float at the left side of the page, I decided to move it to the right as I found that it would be affecting the user's usability when it's floating on top of the verticle nav bar. For this contact section, there are a total of five contact methods: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Email. These buttons are clickable and would lead the user directly to the page that they clicked on. To make sure that the buttons are clickable, when the user hovers the cursor over the buttons, they will show a slightly darker color. Furthermore, I believe that this design change is one of the strongest points that I made to my design due to the consequences of the long verticle website layout. Since my website doesn't have the tradition top navigation bar, this made the layout of the website relatively longer than usual. This made the idea of including a footer not as affective as it could be because it would mean that the user will have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page just to view the contact information of the organization. Because of this, the always-floating contact section would be a much more effective and efficient design option.

      <h2> Self Reflection </h2>
      <p>
        I personally find this assessment to be very difficult to handle because of my limited knowledge and my bad time-management. I spent too much time trying to finish the final assignment for the DECO1013 and ended up leaving too little amount of time for this DECO1016 assignment. Nevertheless, I went through a lot of tutorial lessons and learned a lot of coding over the past week. Due to the several design changes and iterations, it made me realize that there is a lot of limitation to html and css. Further, I found that the website prototype would be so much more interactive for the user if Java was allowed. Overall, the most difficult point I found when designing the website was not the aesthetic looks but rather the functionality and the flaws of the website. In the future, I will make sure to appreciate the website coders out there as I've learnt my lesson that even coding a few pages of website can take up to as much as a week's worth of working-time.
